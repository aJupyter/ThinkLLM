## Project Overview üåü

ThinkLLM is an open-source project focused on the implementation of core algorithms for large language models. This repository contains Python implementations of key algorithms and components for various models like LLM, MLLM, RAG, Agent, LRM, RL, and MoE, helping developers and researchers delve into the underlying mechanisms of large models through specific code. Each algorithm implementation is concise and clear, facilitating learning and secondary development.

If you're interested in full-stack practice with large models, you can refer to the fully open-source [EmoLLM](https://github.com/SmartFlowAI/EmoLLM).
